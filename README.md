# A* Path Finding Algorithm Visualization

This project implements the A* pathfinding algorithm and provides a visualization using Pygame. The application allows users to create different types of grids, including a free-style grid, a random maze, and a warehouse-like grid. Users can place the start and end points and add barriers to observe the A* algorithm finding the shortest path.

## Features

- A* pathfinding algorithm visualization.
- Three types of grids: Free-style, Random maze, and Warehouse grid.
- Interactive grid creation and obstacle placement.
- Real-time visualization of the algorithm's progress.
- Display of the length of the found path.

## Grid Types

### Free Style Grid (Type 0)
Allows users to create a custom grid.
